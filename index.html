    <h1>Privacy Policy for OSAICINTL</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 19, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to OSAICINTL ("we", "us", or "our"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, how we share it, and your choices regarding that information when you use our mobile application OSAICINTL (the "App").</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We may collect the following categories of information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Identifiers:</strong> Device identifiers (such as Android Advertising ID), app instance IDs.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage and Analytics:</strong> App usage data, events, feature interactions, crash reports, and performance metrics.</li>
      <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device model, OS version, language, time zone, network type.</li>
      <li><strong>Optional Personal Information:</strong> If you choose to provide it (e.g., name or email for support or account features), we may collect that information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use collected information for purposes including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Providing, maintaining, and improving the App and its features.</li>
      <li>Analyzing usage patterns and diagnosing technical issues.</li>
      <li>Measuring and improving marketing and advertising effectiveness (if applicable).</li>
      <li>Responding to user support requests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We may share information with third parties in the following limited circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>With trusted service providers (such as analytics, crash reporting, hosting, and marketing platforms) who process data on our behalf.</li>
      <li>When required by law, legal process, or to protect our rights, property, or safety.</li>
      <li>In connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets (with appropriate protections).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Examples of third-party services we may use include analytics and attribution providers. These providers may collect device identifiers and usage data for measurement and analytics purposes.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain collected data for as long as necessary to provide the App's services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Where possible we aggregate or anonymize data to minimize retention of personal information.</p>

    <h2>User Choices & Controls</h2>
    <p><strong>Opt-out of Analytics or Ads Tracking:</strong> Where required by law or platform settings, users may opt out of personalized advertising or analytics collection (for example via device-level settings such as limiting ad tracking or reset of advertising identifier).</p>
    <p><strong>Access and Deletion:</strong> You may contact us to request access to, correction of, or deletion of the personal information you provide. See the "Contact Us" section below.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect information. However, no method of transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such information, please contact us so we can take steps to remove it.</p>

    <h2>International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Data collected may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your country of residence. By using the App, you consent to such transfers. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that the recipients of your data provide adequate protection.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will post the updated policy in the App and update the Effective Date above. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
